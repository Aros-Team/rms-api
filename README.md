# Restaurant Management System | API repository

> A new vision of restaurant management system.

Robust, scalable API that processes restaurant operations in real-time and transforms data into actionable business insights.


## Context

Our first project, ROS, focused exclusively on order management. While it worked well for that specific task, we realized restaurants needed more—they needed a system that understood their entire business.

**That insight changed everything.**

This new platform represents our evolution: a comprehensive Restaurant Management System built around real business needs. We're not just tracking orders anymore; we're helping managers make smarter decisions with data-driven insights that drive actual growth.

## Technologies We're Using

- **SpringBoot 4.0.2**
- **Mysql 7.4**
- **PrimeNG**
